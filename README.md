# snoopy

snoopy recognizes and sets default keystrokes for default users, and starts recording keystroke pattern once unusual data begins occuring.

It fine-tunes its model using ML any time a statistically similar keystroke is used from that point on -- finalizing on the 2nd alien keystroke, and telling the default user. The default user may then name the alien keystroke after alien, and can choose to capture any or all data (e.g. application usage history, browser search history, recording screen activity, etc.) when the named alien's keystroke is identified.
